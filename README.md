# Diamond-and-Tofu

## 1. Introduction

This is a project for our talktalk forum. We are going to build a website for people to share their stories and experiences about their life. We are going to use Django as our backend framework and Vue.js as our frontend framework. We are going to use Postgres as our database. We are going to use Docker to deploy our project.

## 2. Run the project

This project is based on Docker. So you need to install Docker first. Then you can run the project by the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
